# Process Solution Template for Camunda Platform 8

This repository contains a process application template for Camunda Platform 8
and a [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) file for local development. For production setups we recommend to use our [helm charts](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/self-managed/platform-deployment/kubernetes-helm/).

## Using docker-compose

To stand-up a complete Camunda Platform 8 Self-Managed environment locally the [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) file in this repository can be used.

The full enviornment contains these components:
- Zeebe
- Operate
- Tasklist
- Optimize
- Identity
- Elasticsearch
- KeyCloak

Clone this repo and issue the following command to start your environment:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Wait a few minutes for the environment to start up and settle down. Monitor the logs, especially the Keycloak container log, to ensure the components have started.

Now you can navigate to the different web apps and log in with the user `demo` and password `demo`:
- Operate: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
- Tasklist: [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)
- Optimize: [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083)
- Identity: [http://localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084)
- Elasticsearch: [http://localhost:9200](http://localhost:9200)
- KeyCloak: [http://localhost:18080](http://localhost:18080)

The workflow engine Zeebe is available using gRPC at `localhost:26500`.

To tear down the whole environment run the following command

```
docker-compose down -v
```

If Optimize, Identity, and Keycloak are not needed you can use the [docker-compose-core.yaml](docker-compose-core.yaml) instead which does not include these components:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-core.yml up -d
```

Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist, along with Optimize require a separate network from Identity as you'll see in the docker-compose file. Feedback and updates are welcome!
